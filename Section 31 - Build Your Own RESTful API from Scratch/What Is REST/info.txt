REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

Make sure that you have the right language when making requests to a server (HTTP is an example of those languages).
HTTPS stands for HTTP Secure, that essentially uses cryptography to hide the language as well as the message being sent.
A server has API that contains resources that it can expose to its clients.

What does it mean to make an app RESTful?
REST is one architectural style for designing APIs (GraphQL is another example).

Two main rules for a REST architecture
-> Use HTTP Request Verbs -
    GET (read)
    POST (create)
    PUT and PATCH (update, with the difference that PUT sends everything
                   whereas PATCH sends the piece of data that needs to be updated),
    DELETE)
-> Use Specific Pattern of Routes/Endpoints URLs
    This just means that you have to have an organized project where the operations above make sense in group and
    individually.
