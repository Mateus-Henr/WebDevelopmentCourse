Web3 way of creating business

Build -> Release Tokens -> DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

OBS: Instead of money we have tokens

Filecoin - It's a decentralized storage that shares files across multiple devices
that enforces redundancy and by consequence it's easier to retrieve files.

DApp (Decentralized App) - Allows to gather more funding. Through these apps is
possible to distribute tokens to the person that is using the app as well as the
developer.

Pseudonymity is another advantage of these apps as you only need a username, there's
no need for personal information.

To build an app you have to choose a chain, Ethereum is the most common one.
However, one of the main problems of this token, is scalability and computation once you cannot
store data in Ethereum due to its cost.
NFTs are one example of this as their images are not stored in the Ethereum chain, only the URL.
Amazon AWS is what is used the most for data.

Internet computer - Scalable internet computer that runs on the blockchain.
