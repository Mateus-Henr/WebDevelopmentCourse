Tokens vs. Coins

Coins require their own blockchain.
Tokens use an existing blockchain.

Notice that to create a coin just copy an existing blockchain such as bitcoin, like DOGE did.
However, after forking a blockchain it's necessary to have miners to mine your coin.
When creating a token is interesting to have a well-known way to exchange your coin.
Burning a token means destroying it or sending it to a wallet that cannot be accessed.
Tokens can be used for equity (voting/shareholders). Also, can be used for some sort of functionality.
